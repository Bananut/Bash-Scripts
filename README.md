      You can find a few scripts i made by myself to study bash<br/>
      They aren't perfect, but that isn't what this is about<br/>
      I'm putting this on github for a few reasons, but mainly<br/>
      to save it somewhere else than my computer and also to learn how to make a github page <br/>

## Rescourses for learning:<br/>
Networkchuck - to learn the basics with a guided video (very well done)<br/>
ChatGPT - to help me polish my scripts and explain ways I can implement my ideas<br/>

## License<br/>
Feel free to use these scripts any way you want them to
