      You can find a few scripts i made by myself to study bash<br/>
      They aren't perfect, but that isn't what this is about<br/>
      I'm putting this on github for a few reasons, but mainly<br/>
      to save it somewhere else than my computer<br/>
      and also to learn how to make a github page <br/>

## Rescourses for learning:<br/>
Networkchuck - to learn the basics with a guided video (very well done)<br/>
ChatGPT - to help me polish my scripts and explain ways I can implement my ideas<br/>

## How do I use this?
Download command
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Bananut/Bash-Scripts
  ```
If you want to use any script do this to make it executable
  ```bash
  sudo chmod +x <script.sh>
  ```
Then use this to execute the script
  ```bash
  ./<script.sh>
  ```
